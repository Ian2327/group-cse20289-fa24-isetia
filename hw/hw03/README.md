Task 3.1: We would want to filter first as it limits/reduces the number of elements our code would need to sort, thereby making the program run more efficiently.

Task 7:
- If URL does not fetch anything: print message saying no data available and exit program without generating report or statistics
- If JSON is invalid, error message will be printed and program exited
- If URL provided is not JSON format, error message will be printed and program exited\
- If year/month request has no data, //TODO
- If statistical functions have insufficient data, //TODO
- If Word file already exists, asks user whether he/she wants to replace existing file
